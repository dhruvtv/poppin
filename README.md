Poppin
======

Poppin tracks your iTunes library every week to see what's poppin'.

Poppin is a Python app that tracks your iTunes library (the XML file
on your machine, to be precise) and takes snapshots of your
play-counts. It computes deltas of these counts so you'll be able to
find out cool things like:

- What songs you listened to the most in the past week
- What songs you listened to the most this year
- What songs you listened to the most in Apr 2012(!)

Try it out and give it some _time_!
